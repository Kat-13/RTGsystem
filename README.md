## Features

### Multi-Project Management
- **Project Isolation** - Complete separation of data between projects
- **Project Switching** - Seamless switching between different project workspaces
- **Scalable Architecture** - Support for unlimited projects per user

### Stream-Based Organization
- **L0 Whiteboard** - Free-form problem mapping and ideation
- **L1 Program Board** - Functional deliverables organized by streams
- **L2 Monitoring** - Concurrent execution tracking with target dates
- **Schedule View** - Timeline visualization of streams and tracks
- **Executive View** - Comprehensive metrics and performance analytics

### Advanced Features
- **Editable Checklist Items** - Inline editing with save/cancel functionality
- **Collapsible Streams** - Compact view for better navigation
- **Archive Management** - Preserve metrics while removing from active workflow
- **Completion Tracking** - Orange indicators for completed streams with open deliverables
- **Metrics Dashboard** - Total slip days, recommits, and completion rates

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Storage**: LocalStorage (ready for Supabase integration)
- **Deployment**: Vercel-ready

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd rtg-ae-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

##  Deployment

### GitHub → Vercel → Supabase Pipeline

#### 1. GitHub Setup
- Push this repository to GitHub
- Ensure all source files are committed

#### 2. Vercel Deployment
- Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`
- Deploy automatically on push

#### 3. Supabase Integration (Future)
Add environment variables in Vercel:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Architecture

### Data Structure
- **Projects** - Top-level isolation containers
- **Streams** - Organizational units within projects
- **Deliverables** - Functional work items with tracking
- **Tracks** - Execution monitoring with dates and status

### Storage Strategy
- **LocalStorage** - Current implementation for client-side persistence
- **Project Namespacing** - Data isolated by project ID
- **Migration Ready** - Prepared for Supabase database integration

## Testing

### Multi-Project Testing
1. Create new project via dropdown
2. Verify data isolation between projects
3. Test project switching functionality
4. Confirm metrics are project-specific

### Feature Testing
- [ ] Stream creation and management
- [ ] Deliverable tracking and completion
- [ ] Archive functionality with validation
- [ ] Executive view metrics accuracy
- [ ] Responsive design on mobile/desktop

## Development

### Available Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
