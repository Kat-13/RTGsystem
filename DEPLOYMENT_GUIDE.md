- `public/` - Static assets (icons, images)
- `package.json` - Dependencies and build scripts
- `package-lock.json` - Locked dependency versions (CRITICAL for consistency)
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration

- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `USER_GUIDE.md` - User guide for the RTG system

### 🚫 Excluded from Package (per .gitignore)
- `node_modules/` - Will be installed via npm install
- `dist/` - Will be built via npm run build
- `.env.local` - Local environment files
- Log files and cache directories

## 🚀 Production Deployment Steps

### Option A: Server with Node.js (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Extract the package
unzip RTG_AE_System_Production_v2.0.zip
cd rtg-ae-system

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Build for production
npm run build

# 4. Serve the built files
# The dist/ folder contains the production build
# Point your web server to serve files from dist/
```

### Option B: Static Hosting (No Node.js)
If your production server cannot run Node.js:

```bash
# 1. On a machine with Node.js (development/CI):
npm install
npm run build

# 2. Upload only the dist/ folder contents to your web server
# The dist/ folder contains all static files needed
```

## 🔧 Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
Create `.env.local` in production with:
```
# Add any production-specific environment variables here
# Example:
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api.com
```

### Build Configuration
The system is configured for:
- **Framework**: React 18 with Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build Output**: Static files in `dist/`
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers (ES2015+)
